# Pub/Sub

Subscribing yields a stream of messages in your ecosystem's native stream type: an Ox `Flow`, a ZIO `ZStream`, an fs2 `Stream`, or a Kyo `Stream`. Each message carries the channel it arrived on and a payload decoded with a `ValueCodec`. Ending the stream, or closing its scope, unsubscribes.

## Classic channels

`subscribe` listens on one or more channels; `publish` sends to a channel. Here we subscribe, publish three messages, then take them back:

::: code-group

```scala [Ox]
val news = client.subscribe[String]("news")
(1 to 3).foreach(i => client.publish("news", s"item-$i"))
val messages = news.take(3).runToList()
```

```scala [ZIO]
ZIO.scoped {
  for {
    stream   <- client.subscribeScoped[String]("news")
    _        <- ZIO.foreachDiscard(1 to 3) { i =>
                  client.publish("news", s"item-$i")
                }
    messages <- stream.take(3).runCollect
  } yield messages.map(_.payload).toList
}
```

```scala [Cats Effect]
client.subscribeResource[String]("news").use { stream =>
  for {
    _        <- (1 to 3).toList.traverse_ { i =>
                  client.publish("news", s"item-$i")
                }
    messages <- stream.take(3).compile.toVector
  } yield messages.map(_.payload).toList
}
```

```scala [Kyo]
for {
  stream <- client.subscribeScoped[String]("news")
  _      <- Kyo.foreachDiscard(1 to 3) { i =>
              client.publish("news", s"item-$i")
            }
  chunk  <- stream.take(3).run
} yield chunk.toList.map(_.payload)
```

Pattern subscriptions are also available; they deliver a **pattern message** that additionally names the glob that matched.

::: tip Confirmed subscriptions
The plain `subscribe` returns the stream immediately and registers the subscription lazily, on the first pull. That is fine for a long-lived consumer, but a `publish` sequenced right after it can outrun the registration and be missed. To close that gap, the effectful backends expose a variant that returns only once the server has confirmed the SUBSCRIBE: `subscribeScoped` / `pSubscribeScoped` / `sSubscribeScoped` on ZIO (a `ZIO[Scope, _, _]`) and Kyo, and `subscribeResource` / `pSubscribeResource` / `sSubscribeResource` on cats-effect (a `Resource`). On Ox the plain `subscribe` is already this: the call is synchronous and returns once confirmed. The examples above use these so the publisher can't race the subscriber. With these variants the `Scope` or `Resource` owns the unsubscribe, so the subscription outlives the stream's completion and is released only when that scope closes.
:::

::: tip Connection isolation
All classic subscriptions share one **subscription connection**, created the first time you subscribe and closed when the last subscription ends. It is separate from the connection that carries your commands, so a slow consumer can backpressure its own subscriptions but can never stall command replies. The subscription connection re-issues every active subscription automatically on reconnect.

## Sharded channels (cluster)

In a cluster, a **shard channel** keeps its traffic within the shard that owns the channel's slot: `sSubscribe` and `sPublish` target that owning node rather than broadcasting across the whole cluster. There is no pattern form, and a delivery surfaces as an ordinary message.

```scala [ZIO]
ZIO.scoped {
  for {
    stream   <- client.sSubscribeScoped[String]("orders")
    _        <- client.sPublish("orders", "placed")
    messages <- stream.take(1).runCollect
  } yield messages.map(_.payload).toList
}
```

The shape is the same on every backend, using each one's native stream type exactly as classic pub/sub does. Sage holds one sharded subscription connection per owning node and re-homes the affected subscriptions automatically when a slot migrates or a node fails over.

See [Configuration](/configuration) for how to connect to a cluster.
