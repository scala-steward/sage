## Why a native protocol implementation rather than wrapping an existing Java client?

Implementing RESP3, the commands, and the codecs directly in Scala keeps the core free of any Java dependency and gives sage full control over allocation and decoding. It is the difference behind "native Redis protocol": there is no foreign client to adapt, configure, or work around.

## How does sage perform?

Fast, by design rather than by tuning. Ordinary commands from every fiber share one auto-pipelined connection per node: a writer drains the send queue and coalesces whatever is waiting into a single socket write, so concurrent commands collapse into one syscall and one round trip instead of one each. The I/O runs on virtual threads with plain blocking reads and writes, with no callbacks and no carrier pinning, and replies are matched to in-flight commands through a lock-free queue, so the reader and writer never contend. With no Java client underneath, the RESP3 parser and codecs decode straight to your types with full control over allocation.

In practice sage matches or beats the established Scala clients on concurrent workloads. Run [the benchmarks](https://github.com/ghostdogpr/sage/tree/main/benchmarks) yourself: they pit sage against Lettuce, redis4cats, and zio-redis on a real server. No numbers are committed because competitor results drift with their versions, so measure fresh on your own hardware.

## Which backend artifact should I use?

One per Scala stack, all sharing the same runtime:

- ZIO: `sage-client-zio`
- Cats Effect: `sage-client-ce`
- Kyo: `sage-client-kyo`
- Ox: `sage-client-ox`
- Pekko: `sage-client-pekko`

`sage-core` comes in transitively, so you depend on the backend artifact only. See [Getting started](/getting-started).

## Does every command open or borrow a connection?

No. Ordinary commands are auto-pipelined onto one multiplexed connection per node, shared by every fiber, with replies matched in order. Only commands that hold per-connection state or block (`WATCH`/`MULTI`/`EXEC`, `BLPOP`, and the like) lease a dedicated connection, and pub/sub uses its own subscription connection. The [Getting started](/getting-started) "how it works" aside covers this.

## Redis or Valkey? Which versions?

Both. Sage targets RESP3 and modern Redis 8+ and Valkey 8+, where every command it exposes is available. It connects to any RESP3-capable server (Redis 6.0+), so an older server works for the subset of commands that version supports; commands added later (hash-field TTL in 7.4, `HGETEX`/`HGETDEL`/`HSETEX` in 8.0) simply error on a server that predates them.

## What Scala and JDK versions are required?

Scala 3.3.x LTS and later, on JDK 21 or newer.

## Is Scala.js or Scala Native supported?

No. The core is JVM-only.

## Is Redis Sentinel supported?

No, Sentinel is out of scope. Sage supports standalone, cluster, and master-replica deployments; see [Configuration](/configuration).

## Can I run Lua scripts or server-side functions?

Yes. `client.eval` (with `client.scriptLoad` / `client.evalSha` for cached scripts) runs Lua; `client.functionLoad`, `client.fCall`, `client.functionList`, and `client.functionDelete` manage and call server-side functions grouped into libraries. Read-only `*Ro` variants exist for the eligible commands. In a cluster, script and function management is routed to every master automatically. These replies come back as a raw `Frame`, which you decode with the strict helpers (for example `reply.asLong`).

## What happens when the connection drops?

Sage fails fast and reconnects in the background with exponential backoff. There is no offline queue: commands are not buffered while disconnected. A command in flight when the connection drops fails with `ConnectionLost`, whose `mayHaveExecuted` flag tells you whether retrying is safe (see [Error handling](/error-handling)). A watchdog detects connections that have gone silently dead so they are replaced. Reconnect and watchdog behavior are tunable on [`SageConfig`](/configuration).
