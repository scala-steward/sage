/**
  * A pure value describing one server command. `keyIndices` marks which `args` positions are keys, for cluster routing. `decode` never
  * sees top-level error frames — [[Reply.run]] intercepts them.
  *
  * `isReadOnly` marks side-effect-free reads (a future input to replica routing). `cacheable` is the narrower property client-side caching
  * needs: a read whose result is a pure function of the named keys' current state, so a server invalidation push covers every way it can
  * change. Time-varying reads (`TTL`, `OBJECT IDLETIME`) and non-deterministic ones (`SRANDMEMBER`) are read-only but **not** cacheable —
  * they change with no key write, so no invalidation would ever fire. Both are intrinsic metadata set by the builders.
  *
  * `allMasters` marks a keyless command whose effect is per-node and not replicated across shards, so a cluster must run it on every
  * slot-owning master rather than one (`SCRIPT LOAD`, `FUNCTION LOAD` and their `FLUSH`/`DELETE`/`RESTORE` mutations, and `FLUSHALL`/
  * `FLUSHDB`). Inert on a standalone server.
  *
  * `cursorBound` marks a command whose reply carries a continuation cursor valid only on the node that issued it (`SCAN`/`HSCAN`/`SSCAN`/
  * `ZSCAN`). Such a read is excluded from replica round-robin routing: iterating its pages across different replicas would feed a cursor to
  * a node that never minted it, skipping or duplicating entries.
  *
  * `broadcast` chooses how an `allMasters` command's per-node replies fold into one: `First` keeps one node's identical acknowledgement,
  * `Concat` appends each node's array slice (`KEYS`, since no single node sees the whole keyspace), `Fold` reduces pairwise (a durability
  * barrier down to its weakest shard). The broadcast always targets masters regardless of the `ReadFrom` policy (a single replica would only
  * see one shard's slice). Inert on a standalone server.
